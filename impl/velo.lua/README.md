This directory contains an implementation of Velo in Lua 5.1,
`velo.lua`, in the `src` subdirectory.

It also contains a demonstration of running `velo.lua` in a
web browser, under Fengari, in the `demo` subdirectory`.

In order to for this demonstration to work locally, you'll need
to run a local webserver from this directory.  For example,
if you have Python installed,

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then open

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/demo/velo.html

in your web browser.
